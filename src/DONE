Sun Apr 25, 1999 21:54:40: bemused - who on the login screen yields regulara who output insted of swho, so it will often put you in the pager, which you can't get out of at that point

	--  block with 'block page', now.

Sat Apr 24, 1999 0:37:26: snapper - interesting EW/bug: mansoon created an exit called 'manshoon.saloon in his abode' and we can't delete it, as the code recognises the . as a property. ;)  Either a) set it so it knows it isn't a property, or disallow people from creating "anything" with a dot in it.

Sun May 2, 1999 6:07:50: puck - bannames doesn't work
	--  is bannednames a pattern string set?  NO - fix it.

	--  done
Wed Apr 21, 1999 9:50:36: Koschei - create exit allows periods in the exit id, and such exits can't be deleted (or used for that matter)

	--  done

5May99:

    clan accept fixed
	problem where friends not swapped out, fixed
	problem where people lose passwords / can't set: fixed
	verified clans can be swapped out without too much
	  danger.

23Oct98:

	auto-exit use if name matched.

29Oct98:

IMPORTANT:
if any of the basic things are swapped out (ie, /realm), then the Key class 
loses it's reference to it.  either an implicit reference is required,
or we need to use Reference's.  I think implicit is the best way to go, since the 
basic types don't need to be synced out anyway.
	--  believe fixed

why doesn't shortcut work in x?
	--  because 'x' was really finger.  fixed

changed 'construct room' to 'build room' in order to use 'construct' for objects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

support for a 'blank' command that gets executed every single time, regardless?

rename "homepage" to "url"
	-- disagree.  'homepage' is much more descriptive.

cache "commands" output on a per-CommandList basis - to be erased if anything
is sorted or whatever and re-generated.
	--  nah, this is probably rare behaviour.

make a routine in grammar that does substitution for paragraphs, in particular,
text & multi-paragraphs.  This way 'finger' can be done much more easily and
cleanly and modifiably - except there is no way to determine which screen to use
since we don't know private information more than once, but we can just do multiple
screens to remove the 'if' clause.
	--  done

finish doing Factory.makeAtom() conversion, particularly for Internet/Network/Site,
and the initial parts of Key
	--  done

2Nov98:

fixed key.commands.clan.Revoke to allow offline removes of players

when clans are swapped out, they aren't loaded and notified when a player comes online
from that clan.  same with friends lists, but the distinction is that we -want-
a clan to be loaded, and we don't want friends lists to be.
	--  fixed

public "noSideEffectRemove" routine is bad for programmable key.
	--  can be fixed by using anonymous inner classes instead - see Player.java
	--  fixed

'date' command
	--  use "time -"

6Nov98:

make a paragraph immutable - otherwise security violations for anyone who can
read a paragraph.
	--  done

make duration immutable
	--  done
make datetime immutable
	--  done

add a common interface for all replacable objects - to support References,
LineParagraphs, and Types all in the same call.
	--  done
