                Paul Mclachlan, Jason Crane, and George Wright
                        v0.91 beta 21st October, 1998

The main change you'll see with this release over the others is that Key
is now -much- easier to start up and initialise.  I've done away with the
old ".tf" scripts (that required tinyfugure or something clever to run),
and replaced them with custom ".ks" scripts that Key itself can interpret.

It's best to show it rather than try to explain it all - essentially there's
now a little 'menu' for people starting Key.  If you already have a database,
you can access it with 'key admin'.
