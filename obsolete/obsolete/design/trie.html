<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Introduction to tries</FONT></H3>

<P>A trie, while probably not an original concept, is something I&nbsp;developed
for the unique problem of partially matching a word, given the definitive
first section of the word. For instance, if a player wished to 'examine
subtle', they need only type the smallest amount of information necessary
to get this across (for an unambiguous meaning).</P>

<P>And so, in all likelyhood, 'ex sub' could well be enough. In order to
do this efficiently, I&nbsp;devised what I&nbsp;call a 'trie', a name I&nbsp;adopted
from the algorithm which inspired the idea, also called a trie. (The two
algorithms are effectively identical, it is really only a matter of scale).</P>

<P>More information on the original trie can be found in Ian Oliver's book,
&quot;Programming Classics:&nbsp;Implementing the World's Best Algorithms&quot;,
ISBN 0-13-100413-1.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Assumptions</FONT></H3>

<P>My implementation of the algorithm makes several assumptions, the most
important of which is that <B>no key will ever contain non-alphabetic characters.</B>
The other assumption is that names are essentially dissimilar; that the
heys contained by the database have a realtively even spread - that they're
not all very close to another.</P>

<P>The second seems a reasonable assumption to make about the names people
choose for themselves, and the second, a reasonable restriction to impose.
And so we shall.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">The structure of a Trie</FONT></H3>

<P>A Trie is ultimately a recursive data structure, very similar to a tree.
As the leaves of the tree, a trie has the letters of the alphabet. On each
leaf may rest an element, or another branch.</P>

<P>A simple trie, with only one element ('snapper') in it, looks like this:</P>

<PRE>         A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                                             |
                                          snapper</PRE>

<P>Now, if we add 'subtle' to the Trie: </P>

<PRE>         A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                                             |
                 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                                           |             |
                                        snapper        subtle
</PRE>

<P>And you can see that the tree grows. </P>

<P>There is a special case, and that is where we insert two conflicting
names, such that one ends before the conflict is resolved. I refer to this
as the 'at' case. For example, where we to insert 'sub' and 's' as keys
into the system: </P>

<PRE>  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                                      |
      A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                                              |
                                             sub
</PRE>

<P>But where can we insert the 's'? The only conceivable spot has already
been occupied by a Trie.</P>

<P>The solution was to create one more hole off the trie, called 'at' -
which allows for this case, and allows us to hang an additional element,
seperate from the array off the class.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Searching</FONT></H3>

<P>To look up an individual element, we simply check the first letter of
the key, and examine the contents of that reference. If it's an element
- we're finished. If its another Trie, we must pass the request down to
the next trie, so that it may check the next letter along in the string.</P>

<P>If the provided key is too short to uniquely match an element, it is
trivial to extract the matching elements for feedback to the user. This
allows for sessions such as:</P>

<PRE>-&gt; examine sub</PRE>

<PRE>Multiple matches:  subtle and subzero</PRE>

<P>The increased feedback that this structure makes available on a failed
search is a useful feature in such an online system.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Inserting &amp;&nbsp;Removing</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of the better (and important)&nbsp;features
of the trie is its dynamic growth. The trie will only ever use as much
space as it needs.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Exceptions</FONT></H3>

<P>The Java trie implementation owns two exception classes:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>NonUniqueKeyException</B>: Occurs if you try to insert the same
key twice. </LI>

<LI><B>BadTrieIndexException</B>: Occurs if you attempt to pass non-alphabetic
characters to the trie in the key.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">Efficiency</FONT></H3>

<P>A search, even without the full key is extremely fast when compared
to a hash table or the worst case linked list, for the simple reason that
in most cases you don't even need a full key (string)&nbsp;compare.</P>

<P>Insertion, deletion, and iteration are relatively slow.</P>

<P>The trie data structure can also be <I>huge</I> when compared to more
traditional data structures. With this consideration, I&nbsp;ran a small
test where the names from the current <I>Forest</I> playerfiles (5989 names)
were placed into a trie, and the results examined. There were 2,896 trie
data structures created, and the mean depth of the trie search was 3.6
characters.</P>

<P>With these results, even with no class overhead, the trie would use
the equivalent of 27 x 2896 references; this would amount to several hundred
kilobytes. As a trie structure this large would only ever exist in the
system in once place at any one time, this is acceptable, given that the
system is not geared towards memory efficiency.</P>

<P>Since I expect that searching and iteration will be the more common
actions on the data structure (at least in its use here), a linked list
will often be used in conjunction with the trie, slowing down insertion
and deletion even further, but not significantly increasing memory usage.
This list can be used as a method of quickly iterating through the available
elements.</P>
