<UL>
<P>Key is intended to be used to implement a Multi-participant Virtual
Reality, in a similar vein to LambdaMOO, except, well... better.</P>
</UL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">System Goals:</FONT></H3>

<UL>
<LI>The system must support multiple participants interactively.</LI>

<LI>The system must be <I>practical</I>. It must not require large amounts
of bandwidth nor be dependant upon the client having a particular set of
capabilities.</LI>

<LI>The system must be capable of implementing a Virtual Reality.</LI>

<LI>The objects in the system must be completely user-definable. Not only
their appearance, but also their behaviour. The system must, therefore,
be <I>programmable.</I></LI>

<LI>The system must be able to support graphics and sound for those clients
with the ability to display them.</LI>

<LI>Ideally, the system could be 'distributed' to reduce bandwidth requirements.</LI>

<LI>The system does not necessarily need to be small. It is more important
that it is flexible and powerful than efficient in memory or disk space
usage. CPU&nbsp;efficiency is important, however, system 'lag' must be
kept to a minimum.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">System Layout and Interface:</FONT></H3>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>&quot;remove not the ancient landmark which thy
forefathers have set&quot;</I></P></DIV>

<UL>
<P>It is important to realise that the concept of a VR&nbsp;is not entirely
new. &nbsp;There are many such systems, active and successful today which
have established a certain precedent with their user-interfaces.</P>

<P>While most of them have been haphazardly designed, there are some fundamental
concepts that all (or almost all)&nbsp;of them retain. For instance, the
concept of the say and emote. The idea that the virtual reality is broken
into distinct 'rooms' - a way in which normal space is not.</P>

<P>Without good reason, I do not intend to depart from these established
standards.</P>
