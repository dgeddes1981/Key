<h2>Approach to the New World<br>
Some reflection on the goal at hand</h2>
</center>
<p>
If you can't close your eyes and see the horizons of the new world, reaching through
your minds eye, taking it into your hands, then go to sleep, and we <i>might</i> wake
you when we get there.
<p>
<ul>
<li>To provide the best internet ommunity, now and always
<li>What is community?  The grass is always greener on our side
<li>If the talker hasn't got a soul it hasn't got a life.  Soul is not the code but in
    what we bring to it.  We must strike to make the talker live in the minds of the
	users.  We must build on solid ground from the beginning.  The one thing that we
	must all realise is that people feed off people, not code.  If we believe in what
	we are doing then others will believe in us.
<li>The talker must always strive for unity, respect and humility.  The New World is
    not a place to go and get insulted, hurt and put down.  We want the New World to
	be that 'warm fuzzy spot' on the internet.
<li>Consistency from all involved, from the code and in our approach to each other
    and to the users.
<li>Dedication to the spirit of goodwill, honesty and friendship
<li>It cannot be seen as just 'another talker'.  If it does then we have failed to make
    it different.  Atmosphere is the key.
<li>Nourish the devoted and cut off the waste.  Would a farmer waste fertile soil on
    rotten seed?  This is not a part-time talker, we want the user to belong to a rich
	world - a virtual reality.
<li>Fuck popularity.  Our work should represent Quality, not Quantity.
<li>People respect something more if it has that touch of class, that feeling that
    something special has been done.  If we have a population of 100% idiots then we
	will still have a population of 100% idiots.
<li>Agression to detail.  Fidelity to style.  Attention to soul.
<li>We wish to strive to challenge the user to participate in our vivid dream.
<li>It's OUR Dream.  It's OUR responsibility.  It's OUR Work and World.
</ul>

I was once told by a very wise man that if a group doesn't focus on the external then
it is condemned to die from the inside.  In the same way that person who tends only
to their own needs dies friendless and rotten to the core (see Faust).
<p>
If you enjoyed doing it then you didn't do it properly.
<p>
Users.  One or a hundred.  It's all the same.
<p>
No-one writes code for the sake of writing code.  There is always an ulterior motive. I
would suggest that if the code is not written to achieve one of the above Goals then
don't bother writing it - go and join the circus or Microsoft.
<p>
Look to the Dream, Let it be our focus.  <br>
Look for the team.  Let it be our reality.
<p>
<h3>Authors Disclaimer</h3>
If you don't understand what I have said above then tough.  It all makes sense and there
is much more of it that I could have said.
<p>
I know where these thoughts will end up (where my thoughts always do).  I have
conceded that there is a fate to this program.
<p>
If you think that I spent too mcuh time on rhetoric and philosophy (etc.) and not
enough time on concrete suggestions then one of us has lost the plot and you haven't
gained a single thing from what I have written.  Some people say that all that matters is
the Ideals.  I can't necessarily say that I agree totally, but without the ideals we are
just wasting our time on a shallow trinket.  Ideals withstand the test of time - from
Genesis to Melrose Place, what makes them different is Quality of expression (that's
Quality, not quality).
<p>
Therefore I propose the best possible thing for Forest/Key is code that is not the
expression but rather, the code is the tool for expression - simplistic, robust and
powerful.
<p>
If you can't close your eyes and see the horizons of the new world, reaching through
your minds eye, taking it into your hands, then go to sleep, and we <i>might</i> wake
you when we get there.
<p>
Are you sleeping or sailing?
