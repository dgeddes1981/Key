<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">accessor methods</FONT></H3>
<P>Accessor methods were deliberately not used in many circumstances.  The intention is
to make all these public fields protected when the JDK1.2 becomes widely available and
we can use reflection on protected and private fields.  In any case, accessors are
avoided within the same package for speed reasons.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#191970">trie's</FONT></H3>

<P>A Trie, while probably not an original concept, is something I&nbsp;developed
for the unique problem of partially matching a word, given the definitive
first section of the word. For instance, if a player wished to 'examine
subtle', they need only type the smallest amount of information necessary
to get this across (for an unambiguous meaning).</P>

<P>And so, in all likelyhood, 'ex sub' could well be enough. In order to
do this efficiently, I&nbsp;devised what I&nbsp;call a 'Trie', a name I&nbsp;adopted
from the algorithm which inspired the idea, also called a Trie. (The two
algorithms are effectively identical, it is really only a matter of scale).</P>

<P>More information on the original Trie can be found in Ian Oliver's book,
&quot;Programming Classics:&nbsp;Implementing the World's Best Algorithms&quot;.</P>

<P>My implementation of the algorithm makes several assumptions, the most
important of which is that <B>no key will ever contain non-alphabetic characters.</B>
The other assumption is that names are essentially dissimilar; that the
heys contained by the database have a realtively even spread - that they're
not all very close to another.</P>

<P>The second seems a reasonable assumption to make about the names people
choose for themselves, and the second, a reasonable restriction to impose.
And so we shall.</P>
