The sum of all magickal knowledge known to the Tradition is organised
into nine Spheres.  The following descriptions of the None Spheres are
intended to provide you with a broad explanation of each Sphere.  Keep
in mind that there are often many ways to accomplish the same effect.
<p>

<h3>the sphere of CORRESPONDANCE</h3>

   The sphere of Correspondence involves an understanding of 
   three-dimensional reality.  Mages who have gained understanding of 
   Correspondence have come to the (almost) unanimous conclusion that
   space, as the human race knows it, is ultimately an illusion.  In
   truth, all patterns are "stacked" upon each other in one "place",
   refered to by most as the Correspondence Point or All-Space. 
<p>
   In order to interpret and interact with the world around them, the 
   unenlightened need to perceive the Correspondence Point as 
   three-dimensional space instead of seeing that objects are in truth
   "stacked" on top of each other at a single point. 
<p>
<h3>the sphere of ENTROPY</h3>

   The sphere of Entropy covers the aspects of reality commonly called 
   decay, chaos, randomness and destruction.  The theorems used to explain
   Entropy are concoluted, seem to lack any fundamental principles, and
   often seem to have no relation to one another.  The study of Entropy
   can be as chaotic an affair as the mertial the sphere explains. 
<p>
   Entropy is based on the overriding principle that all incarnations of 
   reality eventually die or disintegrate.  Lifeforms die, rocks erode, 
   electricity scatters into random charges, organisations and empires all 
   eventualy collapse.  While this tends to cause the sphere to be viewed
   in a negative light, many mages see entropic destruction as necessary in
   order to achieve Ascension.  They point to a concept referred to as the
   Reincarnation Manifesto, which the [Oracles] seem to espouse. The
   Reincarnation Manifesto holds that Entropy is responsible for breaking all
   things back down in to a basic state of raw Quintessence, which can then
   be recyucled into reality to become some other incarnation of the physical
   universe.  Without this continuous reincarnation, new structures could not
   be created within reality.  Without a continuous infusion of new and
   better fabricated reality, growth toward Ascension would come to a
   grinding halt.
<p>
<h3>the sphere of FORCES</h3>

   All things, even the great forces of nature, are controllable by mind 
   and will.  It is not an easy task; the Patterns of energy ripple through 
   infinite variations at speeds that stagger the mind.  How to command the 
   lightning bolt as it blazes across the sky, before it flashes out of 
   existence?  But such as been the determinatino of mages throughout the 
   ages to master these energies that techniques of trimming their Patterns 
   are now known to us.
<p>
<h3>the sphere of LIFE</h3>

   Life is arguably the most complex of the Pattern Spheres.  The 
   Patterns of Life are far more intricately woven than the Patterns of 
   inanimate Matter or elemental Forces, and while the Patterns of Life do 
   not fluctuate as quickly as those of energy, these complex Patterns 
   comprise countless simultaneous permutations.  Mastery of the sphere of 
   Life requiers extraordinary mental agility and memory.
<p>
   The sphere of Life can also be used to wreak havoc upon living 
   creatures.  It has been used to end lives in innumerable grotesque ways.  
   The Patterns of life shift and flow as the form of life grows or dies, 
   and most importantly, Quintessence flows through the Patterns of life 
   like water through a sieve.
<p>
<h3>the sphere of MATTER</h3>

   The sphere of Matter concerns itself with the Patterns of all things 
   that are not alive.  While its domain is often called the inorganic,
   this is a misnomer - even compounds of carbon are included in the
   domain of Matter as long as they are not part of a living form.  Fore
   example, the flesh of a man is influenced by the Sphere of Life until
   he dies, but from that moment on (when is Pattern shifts from life to
   unlife, and Quintessence no longer trickles into it) his corpse is
   controllable through the sphere of Matter. 
<p>
   The Patterns of Matter differ from those of Life or Forces in that 
   they are much more rigid and enduring.  They do not fluctuate nearly as
   much, and therefore they are not as easy to alter.  However, they are
   much simpler to weave, and a mage with enough knowledge in Prime to be
   able to channel Quintessence can easily create new items of matter. 
<p>
<h3>the sphere of MIND</h3>

   Mages have long delved into their own minds in search of power.  The 
   scope of knowledge dervied from countless years of enlightened 
   investiagtion has led to the development of the sphere of Mind.  The 
   sphere covers the manifold powers attributed to the human mind itself.  
<p>
   Masters of Mind have opened their mental faculaties far beyond the 
   scope imagined bny the unenlightened.  Perception, communcication, even
   control of throught processes are their domain.  Their control extends
   from the glimmers of sentience exhibited by animals to the higher
   faculties of the human mind. 
<p>
<h3>the sphere of PRIME</h3>

   Prime is the study of Quintessence, the fabric of reality.  
   Quintessence is oftern referred to as the Prime, because it is
   envisioned as an indivisible unity, of which all reality is but a part. 
   Pursuing the sphere of Primse is aconvoluted study of ill-understood
   metaphysics.  More than for any other sphere, the Masters of
   Quintessence struggle to find answers that completely define their
   field.  As much as they hate to admit it, even the knowledge of the
   Masters is more concerned with techniques for manipulating Quintessence
   than with true comprehension of its underlying principles. 
<p>
<h3>the sphere of SPIRIT</h3>

   The sphere of Spirit is one of the most definitive and comprehensive of the 
   Spheres.  The theories, models and concepts used by the sphere can be used to
   explain any of the other spheres.  The sphere of Spirit is, by far, the most
   powerful sphere of knowledge because of this ability.  This sphere also contains
   paradigms for tying and untying the Quintessence link that is used by mages. 
   The secrets of Spirit are closely guarded by its masters, and with good reason.
<p>
<h3>the sphere of TIME</h3>

   You must understand that Chronos is not really as he is appearing in the minds of
   humanity.  They are following Chronos down the straight path that he is desiring. 
   They are not experiencing the then, only the now.  They are not seeing the will,
   only the has.  We are outside that narrow path; we are enlightened.
