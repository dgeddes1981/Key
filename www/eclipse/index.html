      <DD>
        The Eclipse of Forest was put online at the 19th of April, 1999 after many years work. This page
        details what has happened since then.

      <DD>
        To use a system to its utmost, one needs to have good documentation. We may not have great
        documentation, but we're working on it.

      <DD>
        It's possible that you'll want to contact the Eclipse team in some form other than actually on
        Eclipse. So this page lists ways to get in contact with the team behind it.

        Many people have contributed to Eclipse in some manner. This page attempts to list them all.

        Eclipse is a powerful beast and you need tools to harness such power. Here are some useful bits and
        pieces.

        Eclipse is based upon <A HREF="/key/">Key</A> which is freely available, in Java and has aims beyond
        being just another code base. If you are interested in what it can do; what it may be able to do in
        the future; trying it out for yourself on your own machine (it's in Java); then feel free to take a
        look at the <A HREF="/key/">Key</A> pages.
