<h1><a name="top">9. Building: creating things of your own</a></h1><hr>
<P>
As a resident, you have the ability to play god and create things for your
own personal use.  Generally, you are permitted to create only a limited
number of things, due to memory and disk space constraints.
<P>
You create things with the 'create' command.  To get a list of the things
you are permitted to build, use '<KBD>create commands</KBD>'
('commands create' also works):
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>create commands</KBD>
---  [base - 3 commands]  ------------------------------------------
    exit, room, commands
--------------------------------------------  3 commands listed  ---</PRE>

	<P>
	Lets start with some of the basic definitions and discovery commands:
	<P>
	
	<UL>
	<H3>Room</H3>
	A room is some place that you can 'be' on the program.  For instance, a
	room might be a courtyard, a log cabin, a hilltop, or a dojo.
	<P>
	More than one person can be in a room at any time, and when you use the
	commands '<KBD>say</KBD>', '<KBD>emote</KBD>' and '<KBD>think</KBD>', they
	are
	all directed to everyone who is in the room with you.
	<P>
	The '<KBD>look</KBD>' command shows you a description of
	the room you are in, as well as who (and what) is in it with you.

	<H3>Exit</H3>
	An exit is one mechanism for moving from one room to another.  The exits
	from a room normally show up when you '<KBD>look</KBD>'.
	You can also see the exits in a room with the '<KBD>exits</KBD>' command.
	<P>
	You use an exit by going through it, as in '<KBD>go
	track</KBD>', or '<KBD>go south</KBD>'.  Most of the
	time (unless there is a command with the same name), you can also use an
	exit just by typing it's name, such as '<KBD>track</KBD>',
	or '<KBD>south</KBD>'.
	<P>
	An exit is in one place, and leads to another.  To create an exit, you
	have to have access to at least 2 different rooms - one to put the exit
	in, and one for the exit to go to.
	<P>
	Exits are <EM>one way</EM>.  That is, if you build a log cabin and a
	campfire area, and wish to have a door that goes from the log
	cabin to the campfire, you actually need two exits:<P><UL><LI>one that is
	in the cabin and goes to the campfire, and<LI>one that is in the
	campfire room and goes into the cabin.</UL>
	
	<H3>Homes</H3>
	Every player may have one of his or her rooms designated as a 'home'
	room.  When you type '<KBD>home</KBD>', you are
	automatically transported to your home room.  When you type '<KBD>visit
	slide</KBD>', you will be automatically transported to slide's home room.
	The '<KBD>ghome</KBD>' command sets your profile so that when you log in
	you are automatically taken to your home, as opposed to any other place.
	<P>
	That's just about all it means for a room to be your home.
	
	<H3>Showing a list of your rooms</H3>
	You can use the '<KBD>rooms</KBD>' command to display a
	list of the rooms you have currently.  As you don't have any rooms at
	the moment, the output will look like this:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>rooms</KBD>
There aren't any rooms in sLiDe.  Use 'create room &lt;id&gt;' if you want
   to create one.</PRE>
   	</UL>
   </UL>
	
<H2>Creating a room</H2>
<UL>
	
	To create a new room you use the 'create room' command, like this:
	
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>create room treehouse The Tree House</KBD>
Built the room 'treehouse' (in sLiDe)
This room has also been set to your home, since you don't have 
   any others.</PRE>
  	
	The exact format of this command is '<KBD>create room &lt;room id&gt; &lt;room name&gt;</KBD>'.  The <EM>room id</EM> is how you need to refer to the room from then on.  For instance, to go to our new room, we can:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>trans treehouse</KBD>
                        <B>The Tree House</B>

There is nobody here but you.

You have transported yourself to /players/sLiDe/treehouse.</PRE>
	
	You can use the <KBD>trans</KBD> command to go to any of
	your rooms.
	
	<H3>Setting up the room</H3>

	Well, we have a room now, but it looks kind of bare.  One of the more
	useful commands when setting up a room is the <KBD>inspect</KBD>
	command.  This command shows some information about how the room is set
	up at the moment.  Our new treehouse might look like this:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>inspect</KBD>
-----------------------------------------------------------------
/players/sLiDe/treehouse is a room owned by sLiDe.
There is nobody here but you.
There aren't any objects in this room.

The portrait reads:  Someone is [in] [somewhere]
-----------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	
	This screen shows the rooms id (<SPAN
	class=em>/players/sLiDe/treehouse</SPAN>), who it is owned by (<SPAN
	class=em>sLiDe</SPAN>), as well as the rooms portrait.
	
	<H3>Portraits</H3>
	
	As you can see from the inspect screen above, a rooms portrait consists of
	two parts, the '<SPAN class=em>relation</SPAN>', and the actual <SPAN
	class=em>portrait</SPAN>.  The relation is the 'in' part, and the portrait
	is the 'somewhere' part.
	<P>
	The portrait itself shows what appears when someone does a <KBD>where</KBD> command on someone in this room.  For instance,
	'<KBD>where slide</KBD>' returns '<SPAN class=em>sLiDe is in
	somewhere</SPAN>'.
	<P>
	
	For our treehouse, we're simply going to change the '<SPAN
	class=em>somewhere</SPAN>' to be '<SPAN class=em>the treehouse</SPAN>':
	
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>room portrait the treehouse</KBD>
The portrait now reads: [sLiDe is in] the treehouse</PRE>
	
		To change the relation property (which you might want to do when creating a hill: no-one is ever 'in' a hill), you use the <KBD>room relation</KBD> command:
		<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>room relation at</KBD>
The portrait now reads: [sLiDe is at] the hill</PRE>
		
	(We might use this trick later to create a room that is on top of the treehouse)
	
	<H3>Descriptions</H3>
	
	The rooms <SPAN class=em>description</SPAN> and <SPAN class=em>name</SPAN>
	may be viewed with the <KBD>look</KBD> command.  The name, if it is set, appears centred above the description.
	<P>
	To add a description, we use the <KBD>room describe</KBD>
	command and the editor.  The editor has some more advanced features,
	allowing you to fix mistakes and delete lines, but for now, there are only
	3 things you need to know about it.
	<P>
	When you're in the editor, you have a + prompt, and whatever you type will
	appear in your description, unless it starts with a period '.'.  There are
	many period commands, but the best ones are:
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI> '<KBD>.end</KBD>' (to finish editting and save your
		changed),
		<LI> '<KBD>.wipe</KBD>' (to wipe everything and start
		over), and
		<LI> '<KBD>.quit</KBD>' (to exit without saving any
		changes).
	</UL>
	<P>
	So, we start the editor and type in a simple description:

	<PRE>
-&gt; room describe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Entering the forest editor <footnote 10>:
  If you're not sure how to use the editor, enter '.quit' 
  immediately (without the quotes), and read 'help editor'

The treehouse is of the normal wooden variety, albeit rather 
rickety.  Several comics are lying scattered around.
+ <KBD>.end</KBD>
Saving editor buffer...
You change the description of 'treehouse'</PRE>
	
	When you type in descriptions, type whole paragraphs on one line if you
	can.  This will make the program automatically word-wrap them to the width
	of whoever is looking at them.
	<P>
	<H3>Renaming rooms</H3>
	While you can't change a rooms id, you can change the the name that appears
	at the top.
	<P>
	In fact, it isn't necessary to specify it when you first create the
	room, either.  We could just have written '<KBD>room create
	treehouse</KBD>' and the room would have begun life without a title.
	<P>
	Nevertheless, to change it, or set it in the first place, use the
	'<KBD>room name</KBD>' command.  Here's an example using colour
	codes.  (Colour codes have a chapter all for themselves, but here's a
	sneak preview):
	<PRE>
-&gt; room name ^MThe slippery treehouse^-
This room is now called <font color=magenta><b>The slippery treehouse.</b></font></PRE>
	<H3>Finished</H3>
	<P>
	Using the <KBD>look</KBD> command now shows us our complete
	room!  The next section shows you how to create exits between rooms (for
	the go command) and mentions a little more about room management.
	<P>
	In summary, here are the steps to create a room:
	<P>
	<OL>
		<LI>Create the room: <KBD>create room treehouse The Tree House</KBD>
		<LI>Go to the room: <KBD>trans treehouse</KBD>
		<LI>Set the portrait: <KBD>room portrait the treehouse</KBD>
		<LI>Set the relation: <KBD>room relation in</KBD>
		<LI>Describe the room: <KBD>room describe</KBD>.  Use '<KBD>.end</KBD>' when you're finished.
		<LI>Rename the room, if desired: <KBD>room name ^MThe slippery treehouse^-</KBD>
	</OL>
</UL>

<H1>Creating an exit</H1>
<UL>
	As mentioned previously, you need at least two rooms to create an exit:
	one room for the exit to go <EM>from</EM>, and one room for it to go
	<EM>to</EM>.
	<P>
	<H2>You need two rooms...</H2>
	The first thing to do is quickly bash out another room.  Lets build a
	backyard for our treehouse to be in.
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>create room backyard Joe's backyard</KBD>
Built the room 'backyard' (in sLiDe)</PRE>
	We can describe it later.  For now, lets use the <KBD>rooms</KBD>
	command to check which rooms we wish to use,
	and their id's:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>rooms</KBD>
  name             portrait                                pl# ob#
|----------------|----------------------------------------|---|---|
 backyard         Someone is in somewhere                  0   0   
 treehouse        Someone is in the treehouse              1   0   
|----------------------------------------------------- 2 rooms ---|</PRE>
	<P>
	<H2>Building the first exit</H2>
	Let us now build a ladder exit that goes from the backyard to the
	treehouse.
	<P>
	First, go to the backyard:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>trans backyard</KBD>
                               Joe's backyard

There is nobody here but you.

You have transported yourself to /players/sLiDe/backyard.</PRE>
	<P>
	And create the exit, carefully specifying where you want it to go:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>create exit ladder treehouse</KBD>
Built the exit ladder in backyard, which leads to the treehouse (treehouse)</PRE>
	<P>
	And try it out:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>go ladder</KBD>
You walk through the exit
                           <font color=magenta><b>The slippery treehouse</b></font>
The treehouse is of the normal wooden variety, albeit rather 
rickety.  Several comics are lying scattered around.

There is nobody here but you.</PRE>
	<P>
	Well, that worked.  If you remember my explanation of the exit at the
	start of this chapter, you'll know that to get back, we need to create
	another exit.  Lets do that now:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>create exit ladder backyard</KBD>
Built the exit ladder in treehouse, which leads to somewhere (backyard)</PRE>
	<P>
	Notice how this time it only leads to '<SPAN class=em>somewhere</SPAN>'?
	That's because we haven't set the portrait in the other room yet, a task
	you can do later on.
	<P>
	Anyway, take a look at the '<KBD>inspect</KBD>' screen for
	the exit we just created.
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>inspect ladder</KBD>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/players/sLiDe/treehouse/ladder is an exit owned by sLiDe.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
No active verbs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Autolook: on
The arriveRoom message is: sLiDe walks in
The departRoom message is: sLiDe walks out

This exit leads to somewhere, designated by /players/sLiDe/backyard.

	<P>
	The inspect screen lists everything that may be customised about the
	exit.
	<P>
	<H3>Autolook</H3>
		This property, when it is on, will force a "look" command after you
		go through the exit.
		<P>
		It is nearly always left on, but the ability to turn it off means
		that, for instance, a room can have a different description when you
		enter through a door than when you're just standing in it looking
		around.  You do this with the 'through' property, below.
		<P>
		Use the "<KBD>exit &lt;exit&gt; through</KBD>" command change to
		this:
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>exit ladder through</KBD>

	<H3>arriveRoom</H3>
		This property describes the message sent to the room that the moving

		everyone else in that room.
		<P>
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>exit ladder arriveroom %o climbs down the ladder into the backyard</KBD>
The value now reads: %o climbs down the ladder into the backyard</PRE>
		<P>
		Obviously, the '%o' is replaced by the name of the player going
		through the exit.  (You must include the %o; otherwise it would be
		possible to make a way of entering someone elses room without anyone
		knowing who came in.)
		<P>
		There are a couple of other codes that you can use here (and more
		can be added if you want one, use the 'idea' command).  They are:
		<P>
		<UL>
			<LI>%h - Replaced with 'he' or 'she' based on the players
			gender.</LI>
			<LI>%i - Replaced with 'his' or 'her' based on the players

	<H3>departRoom</H3>
		This property describes the message sent to the room that the moving
		player departs, or leaves.  The player will not see this message,
		only everyone else in that room.
		<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>exit ladder departroom %o steps over to the ladder and disappears down it.</KBD>

	<H3>through</H3>
		You will remember, no doubt, the 'You walk through the exit' message
		that was sent when you went through the last exit.  This is a
		configurable message, known as '<EM>through</EM>' message, sent only
		to the player as they go through the exit.
		<P>
		You may use this message for anything you please, although here are
		some suggestions:
		<P>
		<UL>
			<LI>Blank it out.  The exit will behave the way old EW
			exits did: just take you to the room and then autolook.
			<LI>Set it, and leave autolook on.  You can write a little bit
			of custom information in the exit, like "<SPAN class=em>You walk
			down the windy road until you reach the bottom of the
			mountains.</SPAN>", which provides a good lead-in to the
			"<SPAN class=em>foothills</SPAN>" room, for instance.
			<LI>Set it and turn autolook off.  Here you can customise the
			rooms description a little more.  As a player walks into the
			room, they have a different perspective (perhaps with less
			detail, or from another angle) than if they are standing in the
			room and 'look' around.  Perhaps if they look a second time
			they'll see something that they missed initially, or perhaps you
			only see something on your way in, and not in the room itself.
		</UL>
		<P>
		It's predictable, but you set this paragraph with the
		<KBD>exit &lt;exit&gt; through</KBD> command:
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>exit ladder through</KBD>

	<P>
<H2>FAQ's</H2>
<H3>How to I make an exit that leads to a room that isn't mine?</H3>
<UL>
	When you create the exit, put the players name, a slash (/), and then the
	room name.  To have an exit to snapper's den, use '<KBD>create exit path
	snapper/den</KBD>'.
	<P>
	You can create exits to clan rooms; use the clanname and a slash, as in
	'<KBD>create exit path osiris/hall</KBD>'.
	<P>
	You can create exits to realm rooms, as well.  Each of the public rooms
	is located in a scene.  For instance, the town square is in the 'city'
	scene, so you can '<KBD>create exit path city/square</KBD>'.
</UL>
<H3>How do I change my home room?</H3>
<UL>
	With the '<KBD>sethome</KBD>' command.  Go to your new home and type
	'<KBD>room sethome</KBD>'.
	<P>
	You can only set your home to a room you have the 'setHome' permission
	for.  This is trivially true for all of your rooms, but your clan
	founder may have set up certain clan rooms that you can set as your
	home, or your net.wife might build a room for the two of you.
	<P>
	You'll want to read chapter 11 on context permissions to know how to
	give the setHome permission to someone.
