<h1><a name="top">6. Personal: setting up your own profile</a></h1><hr>

<P>
As you learnt about in the previous chapter, there are several ways that
other people may request information about you.  This chapter describes the
commands that you can use in order to customise what other people see.
<P>
<UL>

<A name="gender">
<H2>Your gender</H2>
<P>
	Often, you will have already selected your gender when you first logged
	in.  If you haven't, or you wish to change it (huh?), you may do so with
	the '<KBD>gender</KBD>' command.
	<P>
	If you think you're male, type '<KBD>gender m</KBD>'.  The
	females among us should type '<KBD>gender f</KBD>'.  If
	you're undecided, or you just like being called an 'it' whenever it comes
	up, type '<KBD>gender n</KBD>', for neuter.
	<P>
	You can determine someone else's gender on, for instance, the finger
	screen.  Some of the lines will begin with His, Her, or It's, as in
	'Her total login time is...'.
<P>
<A name="title">
<H2>Your title</H2>
<P>
	Your title is the text that appears after your name on the finger and
	examine screens.  (And occasionally in a few other places).  If you
	haven't yet changed it, your title probably reads something like:
	<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------
slide the newbie, so please treat me nicely
--------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	(You can see what people see when they finger or examine you by typing
	'<KBD>finger me</KBD>', or '<KBD>examine
	me</KBD>'.  This trick works with a lot of other commands, as well.)
	<P>
	You can change it with the title command.  You don't type in your name,
	just the last part.  For instance, typing '<KBD>title spends
	too much time online!</KBD>' will look like:
	<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------
slide spends too much time online!
--------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	Something else you can do is use some punctuation at the front of your
	title to make it look a little different.  Here's an example:  '<SPAN
	class=typed>title : first spod of Forest</SPAN>'.
	<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------
slide: first spod of Forest
--------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
<P>
<H2>The rest</H2>
<P>
	I'd love to go into that much detail for everything that you can set up,
	but I think you've got the idea now.  Instead, here's an example finger
	screen, and a little template showing what everything is an where it
	goes:
	<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------
sLiDe: first spod of Forest
--------------------------------------------------------------
slippery sLiDe has been logged in for 49 minutes and 3 seconds
sLiDe is logged in from [jian/127.0.0.1]
His total login time is 1 hour, 43 minutes and 17 seconds
He is 23 years old
Also known as: Joe
His email address is: joe_citizen@hotmail.com
His web page is: http://realm.progsoc.uts.edu.au/key
---------------------------------------------------  plan  ---
"I want to take it back... I want to start again"
Natalie Imbruglia
--------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	
	The template for finger:
	
	<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------
[<span class="replace">your recapped name</span>] [<span class="replace">your title</span>]
--------------------------------------------------------------
[<span class="replace">your prefix</span>] [<span class="replace">name</span>] has been logged in for [<span class="replace">since you logged in</span>]
[<span class="replace">name</span>] is logged in from [<span class="replace">your site</span>]
[<span class="replace">gender</span>] total login time is [<span class="replace">your total login</span>]
[<span class="replace">gender</span>] is [<span class="replace">age</span>] years old
Also known as: [<span class="replace">aka</span>]
[<span class="replace">gender</span>] email address is: [<span class=replace>email address</span>]
[<span class="replace">gender</span>] web page is: [<span class=replace>webpage</span>]
---------------------------------------------------  plan  ---
[<span class="replace">plan</span>]
--------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	
	And a quick explanation of the new terms and their commands:
	<UL>
		<A name="recap">
		<h3>recapped name:</h3>
			<UL>
				You can change the capitalisation of your name.  To achieve
				the effect above, you would type '<SPAN class="typed">recap
				sLiDe</SPAN>'.
			</UL>
		<h3>your title:</h3>
			<UL>
				Your title sometimes appears after your name.  Type '<SPAN
				class="typed">title : first spod of Forest</SPAN>'.  If your
				title doesn't start with a punctuation character, a space
				will be automatically inserted.
			</UL>
		<A name="prefix">
		<h3>your prefix:</h3>
			<UL>
				Your prefix sometimes appears before your name.  Type '<SPAN
				class="typed">prefix slippery</SPAN>'.  There are strict
				limits on the length of your prefix, as it can show up in
				tells and remotes, also.
			</UL>
		<h3>gender:</h3>
			<UL>
				Your gender is indicated with the "His", "Her", or "It's"
				words.  You can become male with '<SPAN class="typed">gender
				m</SPAN>', female with '<SPAN class="typed">gender f</SPAN>',
				or neuter with '<SPAN class="typed">gender n</SPAN>'.  Isn't
				the net a scary place?
			</UL>
		<A name="age">
		<h3>age:</h3>
			<UL>
				Your age must be an integer.  Set it like this with 'age 23'.
			</UL>
		<A name="email">
		<h3>email:</h3>
			<UL>
				
			</UL>
		<A name="webpage">
		<h3>webpage:</h3>
			<UL>
				
			</UL>
		<A name="plan">
		<h3>plan:</h3>
			<UL>
				Your plan only appears on the finger screen.  Generally
				people just use it to write neat stuff, about themselves or
				otherwise.  To set it type the red words:
				<PRE>
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">plan</SPAN>
--------------------------------------------------------------
Entering the forest editor <footnote 10>:
  If you're not sure how to use the editor, enter '.quit' 
  immediately (without the quotes), and read 'help editor'

Limitations:  6 lines, 480 characters.
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
+ <SPAN class="typed">"I want to take it back... I want to start again"</SPAN>
"I want to take it back... I want to start again"
+ <SPAN class="typed">Natalie Imbruglia</SPAN>
Natalie Imbruglia
+ <SPAN class="typed">.end</SPAN>
Saving editor buffer...
You change your plan.
-&gt;</PRE>
				There are lots of other neat things you can do in the editor
				to make editting lots of text easier.  The main commands
				you'll need to know are:
				<P>
				<UL>
					<LI><SPAN class="typed">.wipe</SPAN> - Erases everything so
					you can start over.
					<LI><SPAN class="typed">.end</SPAN> - Saves your changes
					and quits.
					<LI><SPAN class="typed">.quit</SPAN> - Quits without
					saving your changes.  (Good if you make a mistake!)
				</UL>
			</UL>
	</UL>
	
	<P>
	
	The examine screen is very similar to the finger screen, but there are a
	couple of extra elements, so we'll show the screen and it's template
	here:
	<PRE>
---------------------------------------------------------------
sLiDe: first spod of Forest
---------------------------------------------------------------
A bright yellow plastic slight, including a metal
ladder and 15 blue rungs.
---------------------------------------------------------------
slippery sLiDe has been logged in for 21 minutes and 53 seconds
sLiDe is logged in from [jian/127.0.0.1]
---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	The template for examine:
	<PRE>
---------------------------------------------------------------
[<SPAN class="replace">name</SPAN>] [<SPAN class="replace">title</SPAN>]
---------------------------------------------------------------
[<SPAN class="replace">description</SPAN>]
---------------------------------------------------------------
[<SPAN class="replace">prefix</SPAN>] [<SPAN class="replace">name</SPAN>] has been logged in for [<SPAN class="replace">time since login</SPAN>]
[<SPAN class="replace">name</SPAN>] is logged in from [<SPAN class="replace">your site</SPAN>]
---------------------------------------------------------------
[<SPAN class="replace">ranks</SPAN>]
---------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>

	The fields we haven't seen:
	
	<UL>
	<A name="description">
	<h3>description:</h3>
		<UL>
			Your description will appear on your examine screen, and
			also when someone looks at you.  You use the '<SPAN
			class="typed">describe</SPAN>' command to change your
			description, it works the same way as the 'plan' command.
		</UL>
	</UL>
	
	<P>
	
	<A name="msgs">
	Also available are several 'messages' that can be displayed to other
	users in certain circumstances.  You can get a list of these with the
	'<SPAN class="typed">msgs</SPAN>' command:

	<PRE>
--------------------  messages for sLiDe  ---------------------
idleMsg    : I'm eating dinner
blockMsg   : Leave me alone
blockingMsg: I'm busy atm
loginMsg   : Everyone say hi!
logoutMsg  : later
---------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	
	These messages can appear to other people in varying contexts:
	
	<UL>
		<A name="idlemsg">
		<h3>idlemsg:</h3>
		<UL>
			When you type the 'idle' command, to indicate that you're away from
			the keyboard (afk) or doing something else, people who tell
			(remote/rthink) to you directly will get this message on their
			screen, warning them that you might not be able to reply quickly.
	<PRE>
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">idlemsg I'm eating dinner</SPAN>
When you are idle or afk, people will now see:
sLiDe is idle: I'm eating dinner</PRE>
		</UL>
		
		<A name="blockmsg">
		<h3>blockmsg:</h3>
		<UL>
			When you 'block' someone ('<SPAN class="typed">block
			&gt;name&lt;</SPAN>'), it prevents them from talking to you.  If
			they try, they'll get this message.
			<PRE>
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">blockmsg I'm busy atm</SPAN>
When you are blocking them, people will now see:
sLiDe is blocking you: Leave me alone</PRE>
		</UL>
		
		<A name="blockingmsg">
		<h3>blockingmsg:</h3>
		<UL>
			When you '<SPAN class="typed">block tells</SPAN>', you prevent
			just about everyone from talking to you.  (If you have previously
			typed '<SPAN class="typed">allow &lt;name&gt; tell</SPAN>' then that
			person will still be able to talk to you).
			<P>
			When someone isn't allowed to talk to you for this reason, they'll
			get this message.
			<PRE>
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">blockingMsg Leave me alone</SPAN>
When you are blocking tells, people will now see:
sLiDe is blocking: I'm busy atm</PRE>
		</UL>
		
		<A name="loginmsg">
		<A name="logoutmsg">
		<h3>loginmsg, logoutmsg</h3>
		<UL>
			It is possible for other people to request to be notified when you
			log in.
			<P>
			(This is called being informed, and they turn it on or
			off with '<SPAN class="typed">inform &lt;name&gt;</SPAN>'.  You can
			list the people you are being informed of with the '<SPAN
			class="typed">informs</SPAN>' command.  You can also request to be
			informed for everyone with '<SPAN class="typed">inform
			everyone</SPAN>', or just your friends with '<SPAN class="typed">inform
			friends</SPAN>'.)
			<P>
			When they are sent this notification, you can set a personalised
			message for them to also see.  When you log in (connect), this is
			your loginmsg.  When you log out (quit), this is your logoutmsg.
			
			<PRE>
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">loginmsg Everyone say hi!</SPAN>
Your login informs will now appear:
} sLiDe has connected: Everyone say hi! [relation]
-&gt; <SPAN class="typed">logoutmsg later</SPAN>
Your logout informs will now appear:
{ sLiDe has disconnected: later [relation]</PRE>
		</UL>
	
	<A name="hide">
	<A name="webpage">
	<A name="email">
	<B>INCOMPLETE:</B> <SPAN class=incomplete>hide, webpage, email</SPAN>
	<P>
	
	That about wraps it up for externally visible information.  The rest
	of the chapter deals with the parts of your profile that configure
	the way things work just for you.
</UL>
<A name="colour">
<H2>Colour</H2>
<UL>
	Another aspect of your profile that you may set up is your colour
	settings.  Your colour settings don't affect how you are viewed by
	others, but certainly change your outlook on the world.
	<P>
	Colours can not only make your window more aesthetically pleasing, they
	make it easier to work out who is talking to you, and how.
	<P>
	Before you can use colours effectively, you must be using a
	colour-compatible terminal, and indicate to the program that this is so.
	<P>
	First, check that you are using a colour compatible terminal.  Type
	'<SPAN class="typed">iscolour</SPAN>'.  If your terminal can display
	colours, you'll get a screen like:
	<A name="iscolour">
	<PRE>
     The words on the lines below should be displayed in colour

<font color=blue>blue,</font> <font color=green>green,</font> <font color=cyan>cyan,</font> <font color=red>red,</font> <font color=magenta>magenta,</font> <font color=brown>brown,</font> <b>dark</b>
<B><font color=blue>brightBlue,</font> <font color=green>brightGreen,</font> <font color=cyan>brightCyan,</font> <font color=red>brightRed,</font>
<font color=magenta>brightMagenta,</font> <font color=yellow>brightYellow,</font> <font color="white">white</font></B>

If you can see the above colours, you have an ANSI colour terminal, 
and you can type 'term ansi' to force it on.  If some of the words 
appear bold, you probably have a vt100-style terminal.  Use 'term 
vt100' to force that on.</PRE>

	If the words are actually coloured on your screen, you can follow
	the instructions and type '<SPAN class="typed">term ansi</SPAN>' to
	activate colours on your terminal.
	<P>
	Initially, you are given a default colourset, chosen by yours truly.
	It seems that most people dislike my choices of colours, and so the next
	section explains how to change them:
	<P>
	The most important command is the '<KBD>colours</KBD>'
	command.  This command shows what your current colourset is.  This is
    the default colourset (which you already have):
	<PRE>
-&gt; colours
--------------------------  colour entries  --------------------------
     player: <font color=magenta><b>brightMagenta</b></font>              clan: <font color=blue><b>brightBlue</b></font>
     friends: <font color=green><b>brightGreen</b></font>               shouts: brightWhite
     room: <font color=cyan>cyan</font>                         connection: <font color=red>red</font>
     movement: <font color=red><b>brightRed</b></font>
------------------------------------------------------  7 entries  ---</PRE>
	
	To change these, you can use the 'colour' command like this: '<SPAN
	class=typed>colour &lt;class&gt; &lt;colour&gt;</SPAN>'.  For instance,
	'<KBD>colour player brightMagenta</KBD>', to set the first
	entry on this list.
	<P>
	A complete list of the colours you may use is on the '<A
	HREF="#iscolour"><KBD>iscolour</KBD></A>' screen, above.
	For technical reasons, it isn't possible to strictly list all of the
	available classes to colour (it is easily extendable on a per-site
	basis), but here is a fairly comprehensive standard list, with
	explanations:
	<UL>
		<H3>player:</H3>
		<UL>
			This colour is used for lines that are sent to you from other
			players, directly.  (In EW-speak this is your classic 'hitells'
			or 'colour tells').  At the least, this includes tells, remotes,
			and rthinks.

			<PRE>
-&gt; colour player brightMagenta
Effects from player will now be <font color=magenta><b>brightMagenta</b></font>.</PRE>
		</UL>
		
		<H3>clan:</H3>
		<UL>
			This colour is used for everything sent through the clan
			channel, if you're in a clan.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour clan brightblue
Effects from clan will now be <font color=blue><b>brightBlue</b></font>.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>friends:</H3>
		<UL>
			This colour is used when you recieve friend channel messages
			from another person.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour friends brightgreen
Effects from friends will now be <font color=green><b>brightGreen</b></font>.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>shouts:</H3>
		<UL>
			For shouts and other messages that go to everyone online.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour shouts brightwhite
Effects from shouts will now be brightWhite.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>room:</H3>
		<UL>
			For messages that come from the room you are in, such as says,
			emotes, thinks, and echos.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour room cyan
Effects from room will now be <font color=cyan>cyan</font>.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>connection:</H3>
		<UL>
			For inform style messages, notifying you when people log in or
			log out of the program.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour connection red
Effects from connection will now be <font color=red>red</font>.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>movement:</H3>
		<UL>
			For messages sent when a player moves around, such as entering
			or leaving a room.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour movement brightred
Effects from movement will now be <font color=red><b>brightRed</b></font>.</PRE>
		</UL>

		<H3>blocking:</H3>
		<UL>
			For messages that indicate that a player has started/has stopped
			blocking a particular channel that you're on.  For instance
			'sLiDe blocks the clan'.
			<PRE>
-&gt; colour blocking magenta
Effects from blocking will now be <font color=magenta>magenta</font>.</PRE>
		</UL>
	</UL>
	<P>
	Just to warn you so you don't get confused, some of the colours will
	default to others if they aren't set.  For instance, if you don't have
	the blocking colour set, 'sLiDe blocks the clan' will probably show up
	in the colour you have set for the clan channel.  In order to completely
	understand the rules for how this works you have to understand the
	design of the colour system, which isn't something I'm going into here.
	;)
