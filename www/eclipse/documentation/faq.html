        For some time we (the directors and our chosen staff) have struggled to impose our own morality upon
        Forest. We did this out of a desire for Forest to be a 'nice' place for people to be by our own
        standards - where everyone was polite, and where excessive harassment did not occur.

        "I still don't think you have a real grasp of the problems involved... I cannot imagine a more
        fractious and divided audience. Split by religions and philosophies... Have you considered what sort
        of policing a mage would have to do? What sort of punishments he would have to mete out? A mage is
        more than a creator; he must also control, and guide."

      <P>
        After four years, I can only conclude that Morality and Ethics can not be 'imposed' on another being
        against their will, even in such a controlled environment as a talker. The initiation of ethical
        behaviour must be from the individual, a triumph of the human character. As rulers, we (the
        directors) can effect only to provide guidelines for acceptable behaviour.
      <P>
        In short, there will always be some 'bad apples' in the Forest.
      <P>
        In the past, some have questioned our right to impose a morality upon the people of Forest. I believe
        that we have the right as the absolute rulers of the realm; I no longer believe that we should.

         the spider in the garden.
        <BR>
        <BR>
         These incongruities will remind the
        <BR>
         inhabitants of the thorns within
        <BR>
         themselves, the evils that spring forth
        <BR>
         not from worlds, but from individuals."

      <P>
        <STRONG>THEREFORE</STRONG>, the laws of Forest are hereby dissolved.
      <P>
        Our virtual reality will be modified slightly to automate those functions that require centralised
        authority. The individual user of Forest will take more responsibility for their actions. For
        instance, your login site and userid will be publically visible. While this is unheard of on talkers,
        this is common practice on IRC and the WWW (where your IP gets sent to every site that you visit).
        The 'ignore' and 'block' commands will be enhanced; if someone is harassing you, or you don't want to
        talk to them, block them, and if it is serious, consider sending an email to their site administrator
        and/or notifying the police.
      <P>
        The Forest Staff is also dissolved. There are no laws to enforce, and their administrative duties
        will be handled by automated processes. There will be an open volunteer group set up to provide help
        to newbies, anyone may join or leave this group at any time. There will be some concession made in
        recognition of the staff's past service.
      <P>

        Yep, try <CODE>clan prefix</CODE> - it uses the generic prefix command.
