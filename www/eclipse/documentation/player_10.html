    <P>
      A clan is a code-supported social structure that includes the concepts of rank and land. The original
      clans were based upon the Scotland family groups that existed in the middle ages.
    <P>
      There are two primary clan concepts: Ranks, and Land.
    <H3>
      Ranks
    </H3>
    <DIV CLASS="se">
      <P>
        A clan may have up to 6 ranks. The pre-apocalpyse clans had 4 ranks: member, leader, castellan, and
        founder. Each of these ranks had different levels of priviledge.
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <EM>member</EM>: This was the standard level of clan membership.
        <LI>
          <EM>leader</EM>: A clan leader could enrol new members.
        <LI>
          <EM>castellan</EM>: A clan castellan could make members leaders.
        <LI>
          <EM>founder</EM>: The person who created the clan, could create castellans as well.
      </UL>
      <P>
        Ranks in Key have customisable priviledges and names, meaning that they will be unique for each
        individual clan. Your clan founder will be able to provide information on how the ranks of the clan
        are structured.
    </DIV>
    <H3>
      Land
    </H3>
    <DIV CLASS="se">
      Clans, like players, may also have rooms. This can add to the atmosphere of the clan, and provide a
      meeting place for clan members.
    </DIV>
    <H2>
      Being in a clan
    </H2>
    <DIV CLASS="se">
      <P>
        While individual clans often have their own rules and commands, some things still remain the same.
        Generally, the commands to talk in a clan, or view the clan message of the day will be similar. Here
        is some of the basic need-to-know type information for when you first join a clan:
      <H3>
        Talking in a clan
      </H3>
      <DIV CLASS="se">
        <P>
          You talk in a clan in a similar way to talking in a room. You may use the <KBD>say</KBD>, <KBD>
          emote</KBD> and <KBD>think</KBD> commands with the word 'clan' in front of them, to indicate that
          they should be sent to everyone in the clan instead of the current room.
        <P>
          Alternatively (and, in my opinion, preferably), you could use the shortcut commands: <KBD>c'</KBD>
          for clan say, <KBD>c:</KBD> for clan emote, <KBD>c~</KBD> for clan think. (You don't need to hit
          the shift key on the second character, as <KBD>c;</KBD> and <KBD>c`</KBD> also work).
        <P>
          Just to point out the astoundingly obvious, these are the same shortcuts that you use to talk in
          rooms, but with the letter 'c' before them.
        <P>
          Here are some quick examples:
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>c'hi</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle says 'hi'
-&gt; <KBD>c;waves to everyone</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle waves to everyone
-&gt; <KBD>c~anyone there?</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle thinks . o O ( anyone there? )
</PRE>
        <P>
          If you've red the chapter on colours, you'll know that you can colour your clan channel with a
          command like '<KBD>colour clan brightyellow</KBD>'.
      </DIV>
      <H3>
        Leaving a clan
      </H3>
      <DIV CLASS="se">
        <P>
          It is your right to leave your clan at any time. To do this, use the '<KBD>clan secede</KBD>'
          command. Leaving the clan is not a reversible procedure, although the clan may be willing to
          re-enrol you if you ask.

          I hate clans and people keep enrolling me / asking to enrol me
        </H3>
        <DIV CLASS="se">
          <P>
            You can indicate to everyone that you are unwilling to be enrolled in a clan with the
            '<KBD>liberate</KBD>' command. You will appear on the who list as not wishing to be in a clan
            (hopefully this will stop people asking you about it), and the code will prevent them from
            enrolling you.
          <P>
            The command is a toggle, so if you wish to 'unliberate' yourself in the future, just type it
            again.

          The rest of this chapter is a beyond-the-basics look at how a clan is built and customised. It is
          aimed at clan founders and high-ranking members who wish to be able to help in the customisation of
          the clan.

          <P CLASS="c1">
            [This section still needs to be written, but here are some pointers to how to do stuff. All these
            commands will change to something more friendly in the future.]
          <H4>
            Listing the ranks in your clan
          </H4>
          <P>
            You can list the ranks in existance, along with their implies lists, with the '<KBD>clan
            structure</KBD>' command. It also shows who is in each rank, but this will probably change in
            favour of something more useful.
          <H4>
            Adding a command to a rank
          </H4>
          <P>
            You add commands to ranks with the '<KBD>clan rank &lt;rank&gt; clan add &lt;rank class&gt;
            [&lt;optional name&gt;]</KBD>' command. Most commands already exist somewhere, but say you want
            to allow leaders to be able to edit the clan motd:
          <DIV CLASS="c2">
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>clan rank leader clan add EditMotd</KBD>
</PRE>
            You need to set up the appropriate permissions for them to be able to do this, as well - it isn't
            just a matter of them having the command. Look at the chapter on 'context permissions' for
            information about how to do this. 
            <H4>
              Taking a command away from a rank
            </H4>
            <P>
              <KBD>clan rank leader
              <BR>
              clan take editmotd</KBD>
            <H4>
              Adding a new rank
            </H4>
            <P>
              <KBD>create rank mynewrankname</KBD>
            <H4>
              Destroying a rank

            <H4>
              Setting the implies property
            </H4>
            <P>
              You probably don't even know what the implies property means, I caution against using it
              without thinking that you understand it. (It's okay to use it if you think you understand it
              but really don't, of course)
              <BR>
              <KBD>clan rank mynewrankname clan implies</KBD>
