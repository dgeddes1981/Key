<P>Key represents literally thousands of man-hours of work in thought, design,
and code.  Even so, it had very humble beginnings...</P>

<P>At midnight<SUP>1</SUP>, on the 12th of May, 1995, 'Key' was born because of four
university students sitting around on level 3 of UTS with nothing better
to do.<SUP>2</SUP></P>

<P>Since then, I've been principally responsible for its design and development,
yet I am far from its sole author; others have contributed varying amounts
to the project effort.  Hence, the credits page.</P>

<P>Key was originally intended to be a replacement 'Forest'. Forest started
its life using 'EW-too', a piece of extremely buggy (but popular)&nbsp;C
code from Simon Marsh. (I suspect, and I feel it worthwhile to add here,
that the original EW code produced by Simon was quite well written.  Since
then, and before we recieved it, however, it had been almost completely
hacked to pieces.)</P>

<P>The actual Key development 'team' consisted of the Directors of Forest:</P>
<UL>
	snapper - Jason Crane
	exile - George Wright
	merlin - Scott Tierney
	subtle - Paul Mclachlan
	druss - Eric Bicknell
	milamber - Andrew Wilson
	shimone - Nathan Lennox
</UL>
<P>All the directors did at least a smattering of commands work (all the
stuff you see in key.commands.*, and let me tell you now, there's a lot of
them), and so, outside of that, I'm only going to list 'additional effort'
and credits.</P>

<P>The original four were Jason, Eric, George, and me, ahh... Paul. I was
originally planning to write Key in C++, and indeed, I&nbsp;had about 250k
of code written before Java came along and disrupted all my plans. I&nbsp;was
stuck trying to write garbage collection anyway ;)  I actually started the
Java version of Key in Jan 96 (gee, that seems like so long ago...)</P>

<P>Jason, in a monolithic effort, actually wrote all the commands for clans, 
although he was always bitching about how big it was... ;)  I just marvel
that he was dumb enough say 'yes' when I gave it to him for something to do.</P>

<P>George was our fearless project leader, ensuring that we all went to
basketball training and generally completed things on time.  He also sat
down and wrote all our new public room descriptions.  (You'll have to trust
me when I say that most of the old ones we had on Forest truly sucked).</P>

<P>Scott wrote the interface commands to the site tracking code, and a lot
of the normal su commands.</P>

<P>Eric had a lot to do with the initial design of rooms, way back in the
beginning, and kicked off a lot of the room and exit classes.</P>

<P>Andrew has helped me reason some design things out over lunch
- the email validation and priv checking stuff, for instance, as well
as writing the admin port, and, uh, 'playing' with the colour code.</P>

<P>Nathan did a lot of the initial commands work on the mail and news
system.</P>

<HR>

<P>Adam Teague (brann) fleshed out a lot of the online editor (don't blame
him for the design, though, we thought the EW one was complicated enough,
without having everyone learn a new one), adding some nice features (all that
.5d stuff).</P>

<P>I've obviously taken a lot of inspiration from Simon Marsh's original
EW-too code, as well as LambdaMOO and the various MUD servers out there.
&nbsp;(diku, circle and all their varients).</P>

<I>Key is dedicated to Lisa Kim Dow, without whom, I'd never have stayed
on Forest for long enough to get addicted to it (or privved, so the story
goes).  Incidently, that is where we got 2809 from...</I>

<OL>
<LI>It wasn't actually midnight when we first came up with the idea.  It
was more like 10.  But we sat there arguing for a couple of hours about
what to call it.  It took us a long time to convince J that we weren't
going to call it 'snapper'.</LI>
<LI>Well... there was that GPSS assignment, but nothing <I>better</I> to
do, anyway.</LI>
