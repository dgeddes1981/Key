<H1>10. Clans: everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask</H1>
<P>
A clan is a code-supported social structure that includes the concepts of
rank and land.  The original clans were based upon the Scotland family
groups that existed in the middle ages.
<P>
There are two primary clan concepts: Ranks, and Land.
<P>

<H3>Ranks</H3>
<UL>
	A clan may have up to 6 ranks.  The pre-apocalpyse clans had 4
	ranks: member, leader, castellan, and founder.  Each of these ranks
	had different levels of priviledge.
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI><EM>member</EM>: This was the standard level of clan membership.
		<LI><EM>leader</EM>: A clan leader could enrol new members.
		<LI><EM>castellan</EM>: A clan castellan could make members leaders.
		<LI><EM>founder</EM>: The person who created the clan, could create
            castellans as well.
	</UL>
	<P>
	Ranks in Key have customisable priviledges and names, meaning that
	they will be unique for each individual clan.  Your clan founder
	will be able to provide information on how the ranks of the clan are
	structured.
</UL>

<H3>Land</H3>
<UL>
	Clans, like players, may also have rooms.  This can add to the
	atmosphere of the clan, and provide a meeting place for clan
	members.
</UL>

<H2>Being in a clan</H2>
<P>
While individual clans often have their own rules and commands, some things
still remain the same.  Generally, the commands to talk in a clan, or view
the clan message of the day will be similar.  Here is some of the basic
need-to-know type information for when you first join a clan:
<P>
<H3>Talking in a clan</H3>
<UL>
	You talk in a clan in a similar way to talking in a room.  You may use
	the <KBD>say</KBD>, <KBD>emote</KBD> and <KBD>think</KBD> commands with
	the word 'clan' in front of them, to indicate that they should be sent
	to everyone in the clan instead of the current room.
	<P>
	Alternatively (and, in my opinion, preferably), you could use the
	shortcut commands: <KBD>c'</KBD> for clan say, <KBD>c:</KBD> for clan
	emote, <KBD>c~</KBD> for clan think.  (You don't need to hit the shift
	key on the second character, as <KBD>c;</KBD> and <KBD>c`</KBD> also work).
	<P>
	Just to point out the astoundingly obvious, these are the same shortcuts
	that you use to talk in rooms, but with the letter 'c' before them.
	<P>
	Here are some quick examples:
<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>c'hi</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle says 'hi'
-&gt; <KBD>c;waves to everyone</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle waves to everyone
-&gt; <KBD>c~anyone there?</KBD>
(CLAN): subtle thinks . o O ( anyone there? )</PRE>
	<P>
	If you've red the chapter on colours, you'll know that you can colour
	your clan channel with a command like '<KBD>colour clan
	brightyellow</KBD>'.
	<P>
</UL>
<H3>Leaving a clan</H3>
<UL>
	It is your right to leave your clan at any time.  To do this, use the
	'<KBD>clan secede</KBD>' command.  Leaving the clan is not a reversible
	procedure, although the clan may be willing to re-enrol you if you ask.
</UL>
<H3>Viewing the clan message of the day</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
Other clan commands:<BR>
<PRE>
trans clanname/room
clan rooms

</PRE>
<H2>FAQs</H2>
<H3>I hate clans and people keep enrolling me / asking to enrol me</H3>
<UL>
	You can indicate to everyone that you are unwilling to be enrolled in a
	clan with the '<KBD>liberate</KBD>' command.  You will appear on the who
	list as not wishing to be in a clan (hopefully this will stop people
	asking you about it), and the code will prevent them from enrolling you.
	<P>
	The command is a toggle, so if you wish to 'unliberate' yourself in the
	future, just type it again.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>The noble art of foundership</H2>
<P>
The rest of this chapter is a beyond-the-basics look at how a clan is built
and customised.  It is aimed at clan founders and high-ranking members who
wish to be able to help in the customisation of the clan.
<P>
<H3>Quick HOWTO</H3>
<UL>
<CENTER><I>[This section still needs to be written, but here are some pointers
to how to do stuff.  All these commands will change to something more friendly in the future.]</I></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<B>Listing the ranks in your clan</B><P>
You can list the ranks in existance, along with their implies lists, with the '<KBD>clan structure</KBD>' command.  It also shows who is in each rank, but this will probably change in favour of something more useful.
<P>
<B>Adding a command to a rank</B><P>
You add commands to ranks with the '<KBD>clan rank &lt;rank&gt; clan add &lt;rank class&gt; [&lt;optional name&gt;]</KBD>' command.  Most commands already exist somewhere, but say you want to allow leaders to be able to edit the clan motd:
<P>
<UL><PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>clan rank leader clan add EditMotd</KBD></PRE>
</UL>
You need to set up the appropriate permissions for them to be able to do this, as well - it isn't just a matter of them having the command.  Look at the chapter on 'context permissions' for information about how to do this.
<P>
<B>Taking a command away from a rank</B><P>
<KBD>clan rank leader clan take editmotd</KBD>
<P>
<B>Adding a new rank</B><P>
<KBD>create rank mynewrankname</KBD>
<P>
<B>Destroying a rank</B><P>
<KBD>clan dissolve mynewrankname</KBD>
<P>
<B>Setting the implies property</B><P>
You probably don't even know what the implies property means, I caution against using it without thinking that you understand it.  (It's okay to use it if you think you understand it but really don't, of course)<BR>
<KBD>clan rank mynewrankname clan implies</KBD>
<P>
<B>Clearing the implies property</B><P>
<B>Creating a clan room</B><P>
<B>Destroying a clan room</B><P>
<B>Enrolling someone into the clan</B><P>
<B>Removing someone from the clan</B><P>
<B>Setting the clan homepage</B><P>
<B>Setting the clan hall room</B><P>
<B>Setting the clan base rank</B><P>
<B>Editting the clan MOTD</B><P>
