At the moment, Key doesn't have any of the <a href="../vision/">vision</a> applications available.
<P>That said, most of the server itself is already in-place.&nbsp; The
server has been developed and tested with an extremely advanced virtual
community application, called a talker.&nbsp; A&nbsp;MUD you may have heard
of, a MUD&nbsp;is a game, just like Ultima Online, only generally text-based
and free.&nbsp; A talker looks similar to a MUD, but does not have the
gaming aspect.&nbsp; Instead, a talker has much more support for user-interaction
and grouping.&nbsp; I&nbsp;give up, you'll just have to try it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;used
to be involved in a talker called <A HREF="http://realm.progsoc.uts.edu.au/forest/">Forest</A>,
you may want to have a look at it, as an example of what I&nbsp;mean.
<P>In any case, this talker application has been used to build and test
all aspects of the server (each of the applications above only use some
part of what Key can do, the talker can be configured to use nearly all
of them).&nbsp; You are welcome to download it and take a look at it, but
the rest of this page is aimed at those interested in using Key because
it is a talker, and not because it can do everything I&nbsp;listed above.
