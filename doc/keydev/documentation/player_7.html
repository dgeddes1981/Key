<H1>7. Basic Permissions: who can do what</H1>
<P>
It is through the permissions commands that you may specify 'who' may do
'what'.  For instance, if you wanted to prevent snapper from talking to you,
you could '<KBD>deny snapper tell</KBD>'.
<P>
The permissions system in Key is extremely powerful, providing an
implementation something known as 'Access Control Lists' in computing.
<P>
This chapter introduces you to the basics of using this permission system
for yourself.  When you start building rooms seriously, or want to configure
a clan, you should also read the chapter on contextual permissions.
<UL>
	<H2>Overview</H2>
	The permission system revolves around two key elements: <SPAN
	class=example>actions</SPAN> and <SPAN class=example>entities</SPAN>.
	An action is something that an entity may try and do to you.
	<P>
	Some examples of entities include <SPAN class=example>players</SPAN>,
	<SPAN class=example>clans</SPAN>, and the pseudo-groups '<SPAN
	class=example>friends</SPAN>', and '<SPAN
	class=example>everyone</SPAN>'.
	<P>
	Some examples of actions include <SPAN class=example>tell</SPAN>, <SPAN
	class=example>find</SPAN>, and <SPAN
	class=example>seePrivateInfo</SPAN>.
	<P>
	You may set a permission entry (<SPAN class=example>allow</SPAN>, <SPAN
	class=example>deny</SPAN>, or <SPAN class=example>default</SPAN>) for
	any combination of these.
	<P>
	For instance, you can stop someone talking to you with a combination of
	<SPAN class=example>player</SPAN> and <SPAN class=example>tell</SPAN>,
	using a command such as '<KBD>deny snapper tell</SPAN>'.
	'snapper' is the entity, 'tell' is the action, and 'deny' is the
	permissions you're setting.
	<P>
	This is probably a little bit confusing, so here are some more examples:
	<TABLE>
		<TR>
		<TD><KBD>allow&nbsp;snapper&nbsp;find</KBD></TD>
		<TD>This means that snapper will be able to find out where you are
		(important for the 'where' command and 'join' commands) even when
		you're hiding.</TD>
		</TR><TR>
		<TD><KBD>allow&nbsp;snapper&nbsp;seePrivateInfo</KBD></TD>
		<TD>This means that snapper will be able to see your email address
		even when you set it to be private with "<KBD>email private</KBD>".</TD>
		</TR>
	</TABLE>
	
	<H2>Actions, Allow and Deny</H2>
	So far, our commands have only modified the permissions for one person.
	The '<KBD>actions</KBD>' command shows what your current
	permissions look like:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>actions</KBD>
--------------------------------------------  actions for sLiDe  ---
1 entry in the list:
snapper -  [Allow: find, seePrivateInfo] [Deny: tell]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: [friend, tell]
Deny: [summon, seePrivateInfo, find]
--------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	At the top, you can see the modifications that we made for snapper.  The
	list at the bottom shows the default values for each of your available
	actions.
	<P>
	If someone doesn't have a specific entry on the list then these actions
	are used for them.  That means that joey can tell to me but cannot find
	me when I'm hiding.
	<P>
	To change these defaults you still use the allow and deny commands.
	<P>
	Let us pretend that you're deep in conversation in your room and you
	don't want anybody to be able to send tells to you:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>deny tell</KBD>
Everyone can no longer tell sLiDe
-&gt; <KBD>actions</KBD>
--------------------------------------------  actions for sLiDe  ---
1 entry in the list:
snapper -  [Allow: find, seePrivateInfo]  [Deny: tell]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: [friend]
Deny: [summon, seePrivateInfo, tell, find]
--------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	Once we're done with our conversation, remember to allow people to talk
	to you again!
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>allow tell</KBD>
Everyone can now tell sLiDe</PRE>
	
	<H2>Default</H2>
	'<KBD>Default</KBD>' is the command that complements allow
	and deny.  Default clears an entry from the permission list, meaning
	that that entry will revert to the defaults listed at the bottom.
	<P>
	There are two ways to use this command, '<KBD>default
	&lt;name&gt; &lt;action&gt;</KBD>', and '<KBD>default
	&lt;name&gt;</KBD>'.
	<P>
	Here is a script based example of the first, to clear a specific action:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>actions</KBD>
--------------------------------------------  actions for sLiDe  ---
1 entry in the list:
snapper -  [Allow: find ,seePrivateInfo]  [Deny: tell]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: [friend, tell]
Deny: [summon, seePrivateInfo, find]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-&gt; <KBD>default snapper tell</KBD>
snapper no longer has a specific entry for 'tell sLiDe'
-&gt; <KBD>actions</KBD>
--------------------------------------------  actions for sLiDe  ---
1 entry in the list:
snapper -  [Allow: find ,seePrivateInfo]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: [friend, tell]
Deny: [summon, seePrivateInfo, find]
--------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	
	As you can see, the "[Deny: tell]" has disappeared from the permission
	list.  As tell is currently defaulting to allow (see the second last
	line), snapper will now be able to talk to me.
	<P>
	You use the second form of default to wipe an entire person from your
	permission list:
	<PRE>
-&gt; <KBD>default snapper</KBD>
snapper no longer has a specific entry on sLiDe
-&gt; <KBD>actions</KBD>
--------------------------------------------  actions for sLiDe  ---
No list entries
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: [friend, tell]
Deny: [summon, seePrivateInfo, find]
--------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
	With those four commands (<KBD>allow</KBD>, <KBD>deny</KBD>,
	<KBD>default</KBD>, <KBD>actions</KBD>) you know everything you will ever
	need to know about manipulating permission lists on Key.
	<H2>Available actions:</H2>
	<P>
	Here is a list of the available actions, along with a brief explanation
	of what they are for:
	<UL>
		<H3>tell:</H3>
		<UL>
			This permission permits or prevents people from talking to you
			directly with commands such as '<KBD>tell</KBD>',
			'<KBD>remote</KBD>', or '<KBD>rthink</KBD>'.  
			Useful permutations include:
			<P>
			<KBD>deny snapper tell</KBD> - prevents snapper
			from talking to you.  Good if you think snapper is an annoying
			$#)*(.
			<BR>
			<KBD>allow snapper tell</KBD> - allows snapper to
			talk to you even if you have set 'deny tell'.
			<BR>
			<KBD>default snapper tell</KBD> - clears snappers
			tell entry from your list.
		</UL>

		<H3>find:</H3>
		<UL>
			This permission only comes into play when you hide with the
			'<KBD>hide</KBD>' command.  When you do that, you
			may allow individuals to be able to see your location and join
			you even though you're hiding.  Useful permutations include:
			<P>
			<KBD>allow snapper find</KBD> - allows snapper to
			find you even if you are hiding.
			<BR>
			<KBD>default snapper find</KBD> - prevents snapper
			from finding you if you are hiding.  (This works because you
			shouldn't ever have a reason to 'allow find', as this is the
			same as just not hiding in the first place.)
		</UL>

		<H3>seePrivateInfo:</H3>
		<UL>
			This permission allows individuals to see certain parts
			of your profile even when they are set as private.  At the
			moment, this only consists of your email address, however it
			could be extended in the future to include your private florin
			count, or your hidden time.  Useful permutations include:
			<P>
			<KBD>allow snapper seePrivateInfo</KBD> - allows
			snapper to see your email address even when it's set to private.
			<BR>
			<KBD>default snapper seePrivateInfo</KBD> -
			prevents snapper from seeing anything on your profile that is
			set to private.  (As with find, there isn't any need to change
			the default values for this action).
		</UL>
		
		<H3>summon:</H3>
		<UL>
			This permission allows others to 'summon' or 'grab' you.
			Essentially, this entails them forcibly moving you from wherever
			you are to where they are.  You might want some of your friends
			to be able to grab you into their rooms for a talk, for
			instance.
			<P>
			<KBD>allow summon</KBD> - allows everyone to grab
			you.
			<BR>
			<KBD>deny summon</KBD> - (The default).  Prevents
			people from grabbing you.
			<BR>
			<KBD>allow snapper summon</KBD> - Unconditionally
			allows snapper to grab you, even if you have 'deny summon'
			turned on.
			<BR>
			<KBD>deny snapper summon</KBD> - Unconditionally
			prevents snapper from grabbing you, even if you have 'allow
			summon' turned on.
			<BR>
			<KBD>default snapper summon</KBD> - snapper will
			be able to grab you only if you have 'allow summon' turned on.
		</UL>

		<H3>friend:</H3>
		<UL>
			I've saved my favourite to last.  This action can be used to
			prevent people from friending you.  By default, everyone is
			allowed to friend you.  You can disable this with <KBD>deny
			friend</KBD>.  Make sure your read the 'neat
			tricks' section at the end of this chapter if you think you like
			the idea of stopping people from friending you.
		</UL>
	</UL>

	<H2>Available entities (or 'neat tricks')</H2>
	
	Here is a list of the available entities, along with some ideas for how
	to use them.

	<UL>
		<H3>players:</H3>
		<UL>
			Obviously you can use any players name on your permission list.
			This has been the basis for all of our examples so far (poor
			snapper) since it is the closest to the old EW behaviour.
		</UL>

		<H3>friends:</H3>
		<UL>
			Thats right!  You can put the pseudo-group 'friends' on your
			permission list.  How about these ideas:
			<BR>
			<KBD>allow friends summon</KBD> - If you use this
			with 'deny summon', only your friends will be able to grab you.
			<BR>
			<KBD>allow friends seePrivateInfo</KBD> - If you
			set your email address to private, only your friends will be
			able to see it.
			<BR>
			And my favourite, <KBD>allow friends friend</KBD>
			- When used with 'deny friend', only people that you have
			already friended can friend you back.  (Note: if two people have
			this on, someone will have to turn it off if you want to make
			each other friends).
		</UL>

		<H3>clans:</H3>
		<UL>
			Clans can be put on your permission list, as well.   Here are
			some ideas:
			<BR>
			<KBD>deny wolf tell</KBD> - people in clan wolf
			can't talk to you.
			<BR>
			<KBD>allow wolf seePrivateInfo</KBD> - people in
			clan wolf can see your email address even when it's private.
		</UL>

		<H3>groups and ranks:</H3>
		<UL>
			The available set of system groups depends upon the
			administrators of the talker.  There might be, for instance, a
			group for newbies, or a group for people who have volunteered to
			help others out with problems.  For all I know, there could be
			groups for people interested in lycanthropy.  The administrator
			can provide you with a list of the available groups, and maybe
			even create some for you, if you've got ideas.
		</UL>
